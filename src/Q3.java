public class Q3 {
//    Question 3 â€“ Java Identifier Count (Map)
//     Write a program that reads a Java source file and produces an index of all identifiers in the
//      file. (Identifiers are variable names, class names and keywords etc.) For each identifier, print
//      all lines - with the line number - in which it occurs. For simplicity, we will consider each string
//      consisting only of letters, numbers, and underscores an identifier. Declare a Scanner in for
//      reading from the source file and call in.useDelimiter("[^A-Za-z0-9_]+"). Then each call to
//      next returns an identifier.
