public class Q4 {
//  Question 4 â€“ Nested HTML Tags (Stack)
//  Write a program that checks whether a sequence of HTML tags is properly nested. For each
//  opening tag, such as <p>, there must be a closing tag </p>. A tag such as <p> may have
//  other tags inside, for example :
//  <p> <ul> <li> </li> </u> <a> </p>
//  The inner tags must be closed before the outer ones. Your program should process a file
//  containing tags. For simplicity, assume that the tags are separated by spaces, and that there is
//  no text inside the tags.
