    //  Question 5 – Airport Flights (Queue)
    //  An airport has only one runway. When it is busy, planes wishing to take off or land have to
    //  wait. Implement a simulation, using two queues, one each for the planes waiting to take off
    //  and land. Landing planes get priority. The user enters commands takeoff flightSymbol,
    //  land flightSymbol, next, and quit. The first two commands place the flight in the
    //  appropriate queue. The next command finishes the current take-off or landing and enables
    //  the next one, printing the action (takeoff or land) and the flight symbol.
    //  For example:
    //  takeoff( “Flight-100”); // is queued
    //  takeoff(“Flight-220”); // is queued
    //  land(“Flight-320”); // is queued
    //  next(); // will complete the takeoff/landing of the current flight and initiate landing of the next prioritized flight’ i.e. Flight-320
