    //  Question 1 – Car Parking (Stack)
    //  A homeowner rents out parking spaces in a driveway during special events. The driveway is
    //  a “last-in, first-out” LIFO stack. Of course, when a car owner retrieves a vehicle that wasn’t
    //  the last one in, the cars blocking it must temporarily move to the street so that the
    //  requested vehicle can leave. Write a program that models this behaviour, using one stack for
    //  the driveway and one stack for the street. Use integer values as license plate numbers (e.g.
    //  1,2,3,4…). Positive numbers add a car (1,2,3…), negative numbers remove a car(-2,-1,…), zero
    //  stops the simulation. Print out the stack after each operation is complete.
    //  So, entering “1” means – add car number 1 to the driveway, entering “-2” means - retrieve
    //  car number 2 from the driveway.
