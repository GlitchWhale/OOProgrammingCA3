//    Question 2 - Flood Fill (Stack)
//     In a paint program, a “flood fill” fills all empty pixels of a drawing with a given colour,
//      stopping when it reaches occupied pixels. In this exercise, you will implement a simple
//      variation of this algorithm, flood-filling a 10 × 10 array of integers that are initially 0.
//      Prompt for the starting row and column (the starting cell for the flood fill).
//          • Push the (row, column) pair onto a stack. You will need to provide a simple Pair class
//              (storing row and column).
//          • Repeat the following operations until the stack is empty.
//                  o Pop off the (row, column) pair from the top of the stack.
//                  o If it has not yet been filled, fill the corresponding cell location with a number
//                  1, 2, 3, and so on (this number is incremented at each step to show the order
//                  in which the square is filled).
//                  o Push the coordinates of any unfilled neighbours in the north, east, south, or
//                  west direction on the stack.
//          • When you are done (i..e stack is empty), print the entire 2D array.
