    //  Question 6 â€“ Stock Shares Tax Calculation (Queue)
    //  Suppose you buy 100 shares of a stock at $12 per share, then another 100 at $10 per share,
    //  and then sell 150 shares at $15. You have to pay taxes on the gain, but exactly what is the
    //  gain? In the United States, the FIFO rule holds: You first sell all shares of the first batch for a
    //  profit of $300, then 50 of the shares from the second batch, for a profit of $250, yielding a
    //  total profit of $550. Write a program that can make these calculations for arbitrary
    //  purchases and sales of shares in a single company. The user enters commands
    //  buy quantity price, and sell quantity (which causes the gain to be displayed), and quit. Hint:
    //  Keep a queue of objects of a class Block that contains the quantity and price of a block of
    //  shares.
