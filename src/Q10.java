public class Q10 {
//Question 10 â€“ Shortest Distance to City (Map, TreeSet, PriorityQueue)
//Consider the problem of finding the least expensive routes to all cities in a network from a given
//starting point.
//For example, in this network, the least expensive route from Pendleton to Peoria has cost 8
//(going through Pierre and Pueblo). The following helper class expresses the distance to
//another city:
//public class DistanceTo implements Comparable {
//private String target;
//private int distance;
//public DistanceTo(String city, int dist) {
//target = city;
//distance = dist; }
//public String getTarget() { return target; }
//public int getDistance() { return distance; }
//public int compareTo(DistanceTo other) {
//return distance - other.distance;
//}
//}
//All direct connections between cities are stored in a Map<String,TreeSet<DistanceTo>>.
//The algorithm now proceeds as follows:
//Let from be the starting point.
//Add DistanceTo(from, 0) to a priority queue.
//Construct a map shortestKnownDistance from city names to distances.
//While the priority queue is not empty
//Get its smallest element.
//If its target is not a key in shortestKnownDistance
//Let d be the distance to that target.
//Put (target, d) into shortestKnownDistance.
//For all cities c that have a direct connection from target
//Add DistanceTo(c, d + distance from target to c) to the priority queue.
//When the algorithm has finished, shortestKnownDistance contains the shortest distance
//from the starting point to all reachable targets. Your task is to write a program that
//implements this algorithm. Your program should read in lines, from a file, of the form:
//city1 city2 distance
//The starting point is the first city in the first line. Print the shortest distances to all other
//cities.
